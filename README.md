Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Marie (she/her),

I graduated from a 9 week intensive coding bootcamp at Le Wagon. There, I studied HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and SQL. I also did 2 team projects, Overdressed, a clone of AirBnB for costumes, and The Supper Club, which purpose is to help host who wants to organize a dinner party.

I aspire to be a frontend developer with strong backend knowledge.

I'm currently working on several personal projects.
I'm also deepening my knowledge of Javascript and of the web.

Feel free to message me if you have questions!
