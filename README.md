Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Marie (she/her),

I graduated from a 9 week intensive coding bootcamp at Le Wagon in June. There, I studied HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and SQL. I also did 2 team projects in Rails: Overdressed, a clone of AirBnB for costumes, and The Supper Club, which purpose is to help host who wants to organize a dinner party.

I aspire to be a skilled full-stack developer.

I'm currently working on personal projects in Javascript.

Feel free to message me if you have questions!
